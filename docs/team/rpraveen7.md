## Project: GitSwole

GitSwole provides fast, CLI-based workout tracking for gym-goers who dislike slow GUI apps and manual logs. 
Single-command entry enables efficient logging of exercises, sets, and weights, with instant access to workout history 
and progress tracking optimized for keyboard-comfortable users.
It is written in Java, and has about 700 LoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New Feature: Multi-Tiered Listing Mechanism (`ListCommand`)

* **What it does:** Allows users to view their data at three different granularities: a summary of all workout 
sessions (`list`), a detailed view of a specific workout and its exercises (`list w/WORKOUT`), and a 
global view of all exercises across all sessions (`list all`).
* **Justification:** Users need to quickly navigate their routines. A summary view helps find the right session, 
while the detailed view provides the actual training data. "List all" serves as a quick inventory of the user's 
entire exercise repertoire.
* **Technical Depth:** 
    * **State-Aware Listing:** The command uses flag-based routing (`w/` vs `all`) to determine display depth. 
    * **Status Integration:** For the `list` and `list w/WORKOUT` variations, the UI integrates completion 
    status indicators (`[X]` or `[ ]`) directly into the output, allowing users to see progress at a glance.
    * **Whitespace Tolerance:** The parser was specifically enhanced to trim and sanitize the `w/` input, 
    making it resilient to leading/trailing spaces often entered on mobile-synced CLI environments.

### New Feature: Smart Workout Logging (`LogCommand`)

* **What it does:** Enables real-time logging of daily training performance. It allows users to record 
weights (`wt/`), sets (`s/`), reps (`r/`), and custom remarks (`remark/`) for any exercise.
* **Justification:** To provide a friction-less gym experience, the command supports **"Sticky Sessions"**—after 
starting a session (`log w/`), the app maintains an internal active state. This allows subsequent exercise updates 
via `log e/` to omit the workout name entirely, minimizing typing during high-intensity training.
* **Technical Depth:** 
    * **Dual-State Logic:** The command dynamically switches between "Session Initialization" (writing a 
    date-stamped header) and "Exercise Performance Logging" based on the presence of the `e/` flag.
    * **Optional Field Inheritance:** The implementation allows for partial updates. If optional flags like 
    `wt/` or `s/` are omitted, the command intelligently inherits the last known values from the workout 
    template, preventing data loss while reducing mandatory input.
    * **Terminal Remark Handling:** Implemented a specialized parser for the `remark/` flag to ensure it acts 
    as a terminal input, allowing for multi-word comments without interfering with subsequent numeric flags.

### New Feature: Persistent History Storage (`HistoryStorage`)

* **What it does:** Manages the `history.txt` file, which records every completed training session with a 
"Smart Overwriting" mechanism.
* **Justification:** Unlike a template-based storage, history tracking requires maintaining a chronological log. 
Users often make typos while logging stats in the gym; smart overwriting ensures that re-entering a log corrects 
the existing entry for the day rather than creating duplicates.
* **Highlights:** The storage logic identifies session blocks by date and workout name, then performs 
surgical updates within that block. This keeps the history file clean and human-readable.

### Project Management

* **Architectural Oversight:** Designed and implemented the core command routing logic for logging and history, 
ensuring a scalable pattern for persistent session tracking
* **Code Quality Assurance:** Implemented extensive assertion checks in the command classes to ensure system state 
integrity during execution.

### Enhancements to Existing Features

* **Smart Session Resumption:** Implemented a check in `LogCommand` and `HistoryStorage` to detect if a session for a 
workout has already been started today. This prevents redundant header entries in `history.txt`.
    * *Example:* If a user logs an exercise, then logs another one later, both will be grouped under one 
  "Push Day" header for that date.
* **Robust Data Integrity & Overflow Protection:** Refactored the `Parser` to implement `parseAndValidateInt`, 
which prevents numeric overflow from large inputs (e.g., `wt/9999999`) that previously corrupted the storage files. 
Added realistic physical limits (e.g., 1000kg) to maintain data quality.
* **Smart Context-Aware Error Guidance:** Implemented a global exercise search mechanism in `LogCommand`. 
If a user attempts to log an exercise under the wrong session, the app proactively suggests the correct workout 
(e.g., *"Did you mean to log this under Push Day?"*).
* **Strict Command & Flag Validation:** Enhanced the parser to detect unrecognized flags (e.g., `wol/` instead 
of `wt/`) and resolve flag collisions (e.g., `remark/` bleeding into other fields). This prevents typos from 
being silently ignored and ensures every command is executed exactly as intended.
* **Header Collision Resolution in Storage:** Fixed a critical bug in `HistoryStorage` where shorter workout 
names (e.g., "ARM") would incorrectly match longer ones (e.g., "WARM") during history scans. Implemented precise 
suffix-matching to ensure historical logs are never misattributed.
* **Operational Guardrails:** Added validation to prevent the creation of empty workout sessions or marking 
workouts without exercises as "done," ensuring a consistent "Define -> Log" workflow.
* **Case-Insensitive Input Handling:** Optimized both `ListCommand` and `LogCommand` to handle user input 
case-insensitively, reducing friction for CLI users.
    * *Example:* Both `list w/puSh dAy` and `log w/PUSH DAY` will correctly target the "Push Day" workout session.
